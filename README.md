# NYT Scrubber

This is a personal project I am working on. I was experimenting with create-react-app and yarn to create a full-stack app that gets information from the New York Times API and allows you to save articles in a mongo database.

## Getting Started

To go to the Live Site go to https://article-scraper-cac.herokuapp.com/
Once there you have access to the scraper and information that is powered by https://www.foxsports.com/soccer
Each Article contains a title and a link that will lead you to the article in the fox sports site.

### Prerequisites

All you need is your browser. No install required. The site uses mongodb to store articles and notes associated with specific articles. 
For more information on create-react-app and how it works go to https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app
